This document is the outline for SMVS, or the Samr Month Versioning System.

SMVS is a version numbering system devised by [samr](https://github.com/samrland) to create an easier system for developers to use.

Everything written in this document is under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## summary

Given a version number YEAR.MONTH[MINOR]:

- YEAR should be the calendar year which the specific version of the software is released in
- MONTH should be the calendar month which the specific version of the software is released in
- MINOR should be a Latin alphabet character, incrementing for each minor version release

For example, a piece of software on its third minor revision within the month of April 2021 would be 2021.4c.

- The software is released in the year of 2021
- The software is released in the month of April (the fourth month)
- The software is on its third revision in April 2021 ('c' is the third letter of the Latin alphabet)
